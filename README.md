# Caesar-Cipher

This project is a simple encryption program based on the English language, inspired by the Caesar cipher and Alan Turing when he successfully broke the Enigma code. This program is based on Python and aims to automatically track shifts in sentences and then provide output after matching the frequency of letter occurrences in the sentence with the frequency of letters in English.

**Key Features**	
  * Decrypting encrypted sentences in English automatically.

**Objectives**
  * To serve as a learning and practice platform for anyone intending to learn encryption.

**Limitations**
This project has several limitations to consider:
  1.	Can only perform decryption in English.
  2.	So far, it has only been tested using formal sentences and some slang words; there may be a decrease in effectiveness with sentences that utilize slang words
  3.	Built using Python 3.11.5, there may be differences in output with other versions of Python.

**License**
  This project has no license, since all the data is public data.
